# IT3030 Deep Learning

## Project 1 - Neural Network from scratch

In `./project_1` we implemented a feed-forward neural network from scratch with NumPy.

## Project 2 - Recurrent neural network from scratch

In `./project_2` we implemented a recurrent neural network (RNN) from scratch with NumPy.

## Project 3 - Semi-supervised learning

In `./project_3` we implemented semi-supervised learning with Keras over the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), [Fasion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), [CIFAR10](https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar10/) and the [CIFAR100](https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar100/) dataset.
