# Project 1

This project deals with classification of simple figures with a feed-forward neural network built from scratch with NumPy.

## Data generator
Create new figures by running `data_generator.py`. The generator creates figures with respect to the the configuration variables from `data_generator_config.yaml`.

## Neural network
Train the network by running `main.py`, also with respect to the configuration variables in `config.yaml` (such as batch size, epochs, neural network architecture etc.).
