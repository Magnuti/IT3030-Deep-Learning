# Project 2 - Recurrent Neural Network

This project is an extension of the first project, where we add recurrent layers to our neural network.

The data we want to classify is now sequential instead of images.

## Data generator
Create new sequences by running `data_generator.py`. The generator creates sequences with respect to the the configuration variables from `data_generator_config.yaml`.

## Recurrent Neural network
Train the network by running `main.py`, also with respect to the configuration variables in `config.yaml` (such as batch size, epochs, neural network architecture etc.).
